I learned that it's important for a website to have a logical flow and find the right balance between presenting a lot of information and choices and just a few.  It's also important for the advertising to stand out.

I enjoyed creating the wireframes.  If I had more time I could have gone into greater detail.

My question was "How am I going to create a nice looking wireframe?"  I asked my accountablility mate Max and he recommened Balsamiq.

I learned how to use Balsamiq.

Pretty confident.

I enjoyed laying out the images.  It was a little tedious finding the graphics in Balsamiq that I wanted to use but I'm sure if I use it more I'll become more familiar with what is available.
