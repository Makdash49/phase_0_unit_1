## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Nesting makes sense to me.  You open a box, you put a smaller box inside, with a smaller box inside it.  Then you close the first box with everything.  

What doesn't make sense?  It all makes sense.  I just don't know much yet.  I haven't seen enough to be confused.

What's good is that it requires you to be very specific about what you want.  What's bad is that you have to previsualize everything.  When I work in Word, I change font sizes and move things around until it feels right.  In that way, my work feels more hands on.

I think concepts were solidified this time.  How to make an image a link.  It was good practice.  I've done it before but it was good to have a refresher.

I did some Google Searches to answer some questions.
