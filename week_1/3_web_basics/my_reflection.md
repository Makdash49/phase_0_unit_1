## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned that the internet is not the same as the Web.  The internet came first and the web makes it look pretty and easy to use for regular folks.

I also learned that websites have IP addresses which you can type to get to the website, if you want to do something other than type the easy to remember name.

When you set up your HTML site, remember how to code in HTML.  That's a start.  After that, don't forget to commit the changes you make in Sublime through the GitHub App and then sync it up to GitHub.

When I first tried to see my web page live, it wasn't there so I felt disappointed and worried that I had messed something up.  Then I tried a few things and it did work.  Not sure what did it.  It might have just taken a minute to update on the web.  Then I felt relieved and happy.  Yep, there's my bad ass website!  More to come, and they can only get better.

My aha moment was when I saw what I typed in Sublime on GitHub.  I was like:  Oh, that's what this was all about.  Having a comfy editor I can work in on my computer but then have the changes update to the web.

I talked through some problems with Max and I offered some solutions.  I don't have a rubber duck but Max made for a good proxy.  He encouraged me to try the solution I proposed.  I did, and a few more things and I got things working.
