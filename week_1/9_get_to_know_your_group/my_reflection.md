Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

Hey Accountability Group!

Thank you for you help this week!  I couldn't have gotten through without you!

 It was nice to see other people have the same fears I have.  I am not alone.  I was a little scared I would not meet my deadline of finishing week 1 tonight but I have, so sometimes what seems impossible is possible with some focus and effort.  I couldn't have done it without the help of my accoutability group.  They all tutored me.  I hope I can make it through next week.  I'd really like to be caught up to begin week 3 with everyone else.
