## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

You create a repository on GitHub by following the directions as I did.  You name the repo, set its privacy, and give it a license.  You also follow the directions to create a repository to your local computer using the Git App.  It just took a couple clicks to find and 

Open Source means that the code for software as it was written by people can be read by people.  It can be copied and updated and changed.  People can make different versions of it.  Through community the software has a life of its own.

I really like Open Source.  It doesn't really make me feel nervous or protective.  Maybe it would be good to be a little protective but I don't feel worried about that at the moment.  It does feel like utopia.  People working together to make more functional and helpful tools for the sake of making the world a better place.  It would be great if this kind of consiousness could exist in all aspets of human civilization.  That really would be utopia.  Of course, I realize coders aren't all angels.  They write viruses and hack private information, so it is important to be somewhat protective.

It's important to use licenses so that you are clear with yourself and others about how software can be used, changed, and shared.  It's also important so that you can make your case in court if someone does not use software as specified.

I'm much more clear about Open Source.  I didn't realize that code used by a computer cannot be read by people.  Source Code is something I know about now.  Thanks DBC!

The resources that helped were my girlfriend Sonia (who manages coders) and my fellow accountability members Justin and Max.
