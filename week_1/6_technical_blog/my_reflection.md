## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: http://makdash49.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

Basically, at this point my main goal is to catch up while still learning a tremendous amount and connecting with the DBC community.  In the future I would like to spend much more time on this assignment, but for now my goal was to get it done.

With that said, this assignment did give me a chance to consider the design of some of my favorite websites and to consider how they affect me.  I know from now on I will be more conscious of the design of websites I encounter and I will try to apply my experiences to my web design.  I found it valuable.
