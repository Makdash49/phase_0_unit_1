Some struggles setting up git and GitHub:  I didn't have any problems seting up GitHub although once it was set up I didn't really understand what it was or how to navigate it.  Git was a little more complicated.  I discovered that my iMac had an old operating system which would not install git.  To update my OS I would first need to backup everything on my computer, which could take a while.  Fortunately, my girlfriend has a MacBook that she lent me.  Unfortunately, she couldn't remember the password for installing software, so it looked like I was stuck.  After further conversation, she remembered a piece a paper that had the password and now I'm back in business.  I will be getting my own laptop next week so I will get to do this again and hopefully it will go perfectly smoothly.

What did I learn?  Current software sometimes does not run on old operating systems.  When you update an operating system you want to backup your computer first.  It's important to remember where you saved your passwords.  Ultimately, never give up, never surrender.

Git is a system which allows you save different versions of a program as you are writing it.  It remembers what changes you made and when.  You have to commit to a change for it to be registered.  You can jump around different versions and the story of what you do and when will be recorded for posterity.  If you really screw something up, don't worry, you can go back to a happier time before you screwed it up, and try try try again.  Git exists on your computer.

GitHub is like git except it is on the web.  Like in the cloud.  And people from all over the world can work together creating different versions of programs and all of them will be saved.  This way, if you like some code and you want to mess with it, you can, without upsetting anyone, because the version that existed before you got there, still exists and can be easily accesed.

Version Control is a system of keeping track of different versions of programs.  It keeps track of the changes that were committed and when.  It allows a user to access different versions in various timelines and to create new versions.

Developers use version control so that they can feel free to try new ideas that might not work so that they can find something that does.  If a program stops working, they can go back to a version that did what it was supposed to do.  Also, a developer can go back to a version that is nothing like the latest version and find something in it that might be useful.

Also, version control keeps a record of who did what and when so if there is something in the code that doesn't make sense to a developer, they may be able to contact the person who wrote it and get an explanation.  Who knows?  Maybe a bit of code doesn't make sense to you but that doesn't mean it doesn't do something useful.

This all makes sense to me.  I wish I could live my whole life like this.  It would be kind of like the movie Groundhog's Day except more user friendly.

What doesn't make sense?  Hmmm.  I don't know how to navigate it yet, but I'm sure I will find out soon.

Wait!  Hold the presses!  I just learned that you cannot hit the "Commit changes" button if you are using an old version of Safari.  I switched to Google Chrome and now I can do it.  Yay!
