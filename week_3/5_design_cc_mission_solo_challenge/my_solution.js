// This is a solo challenge

// Your mission description:
// To defeat the Orge you gather your troops and move towards the Ogre.
//Once the Ogre sees you he will start to come after you.
//Run away and have your troops follow.  Go to the the boat on the side of the river.
//Get in and your troops will get in too.  Then the boat will start to go down the river towards the waterfall.
//Tell your troops to row across the river.  Tell them to "Row faster!"
//At this point the Ogre will have gotten into his own boat and will be coming down the river.
//He will not be able to row as fast as your troops so he will end up going over the waterfall to his death.
//You and your troops will land safely on the other side of the river.
// 
// 

// Pseudocode
// Say "follow me" to troops
//Move to middle of screen
//Taunt Ogre
//Ogre wil begin to follow
//Run away!
//Get in boat and troops will follow.
//Boat will start to go down river.
//Message to troops: "Start rowing!"
//Second message to troops "Row harder!""
// 
// 
// 
//
