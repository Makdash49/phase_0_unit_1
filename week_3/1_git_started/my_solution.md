## Release 4: Git Workflow

- Push files to a remote repository
Check if file has been staged with git status.
If there are changes type:  git add file.txt to double-check changes.  Commit files with your comment. Add origin to push files to remote repo.


- Fetch changes
On the remote add origin.  Then add upstream repo.  Get changes from upstream repo.  Merge changes with remote repo..  Git commit with comment.  Push origin master.

- Commit locally
Use git status to see if file has been staged.
If changes not updated:  git add file.txt.
Commit files: git commit -m with your comment.



## Release 5: Errors you encountered
1. Error
Git was telling me:  fatal: remote origin already exists.

2. Solution
It turned out I had not followed the instructions correctly and I had named the remote "username" rather than using my username.

3. Cause (explain the error)  I did some research online and found out how to rename a remote.  https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-remote#troubleshooting

## Release 6: Reflection

Using the terminal was a little scary.  Fortunately, I had detailed instructions to follow.  Unfortunately, I sometimes misunderstood the directions of missed a step.  This resulted in errors.  Then I did some google searches to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it.

I'm not totally confident about using git at the moment.  I believe I need a bit more practice before I get really good at it and totally comfortable.  I'm sure I will be look at  the instructions again the next time I use it.
