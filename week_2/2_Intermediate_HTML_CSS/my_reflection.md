# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
I think web standards are good because they layout guidelines to help ensure all people, including people with special needs, have access to the web.  They also can make web development faster and more enjoyable although some people fear they are limiting.  It's important to create universal standards rather than let one company dictate the standards.

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
Yes, it seems like it has a logical flow.  Head, body, header, section, article, aside, footer.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
Yes.  Because they create a structure that I can use without having to define ids or classes.

* Why is reset.css necessary? 
Reset.css is necessary so that you can create a page with a fresh start.  Otherwise the page may reacte to CSS formatting given to it by a page other than the page you created.


* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
I've used Safari and Google Chrome.  I haven't really noticed that sites look different but I will pay more attention to that.  I have noticed that some site functions work better in different browsers.  I think it is probably not a good thing that sites are different in different browsers.  Designers probably want their sites to be consistent no matter where it is viewed.


* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Yes.  I found this reset CSS page:
