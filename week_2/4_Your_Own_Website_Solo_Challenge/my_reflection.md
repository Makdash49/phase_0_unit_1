# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://makdash49.github.io/

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience?
It's important the a website have a logical flow to it.  It's helpful for the website to interact with the user, for instance links become bold when the user hovers the mouse over them.


* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
I enjoyed working on the wireframe because I could put it together easily with a wire frame tool.  It was challenging to put the website together and there is still much I can learn and try to understand.  It was exciting to see what was working and disappointing to see what didn't.


* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
I liked doing research and looking at other websites to see how they were put together to see if I could incorporate some of what I saw.  Much of the time I couldn't understand what I was seeing but having the Chrome Dev tool has made things clearer.



* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
The footer is not working properly.  I would like to have it span across the bottom.


* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
I like the hover psuedo classes.  I think it cool when things change when you put the cursor over them.


* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
