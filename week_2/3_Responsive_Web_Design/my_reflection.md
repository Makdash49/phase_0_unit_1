# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
Responsive web design is web design that responds effectively to the size of the screen in which the user is using.  To do this it doesn't use only pixels as units for width.  It used ems.  Ems are more relative.  Also it uses percentages and fluid grids and media queries.


* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

Smarthphones and tablets have made it necessary for web apps and pages to adapt to the technology they are being interacted on and still look good.

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

I imagine visually imparied people use the web primarily with techology that reads outloud what appears on a web page.  I think I have heard about braille technology that visually impaired people can use to access the web.  We absolutely should design for them so that they can have access to information, their own independence, and be able to make contributions to society.



* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

It makes sense to me that websites would need to adapt to different technologies so that they are still usable and beautiful.  What doesn't make sense?  There is so much that I don't understand that I don't know where to begin.
