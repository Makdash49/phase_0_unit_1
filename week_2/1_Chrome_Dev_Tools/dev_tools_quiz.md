#### Include an inline screenshot of your codeschool's points from the profile page:


##QUIZ
* Explain which tabs support the following actions and how.
  * Realtime editing of HTML and CSS 
    "Elements tab"

  * Javascript Debugging
  "Sources Tab?"

  * Performance Optimization
  "Network tab"

* What's the quick key for your OS to spawn the Dev Tools inspector?
"Command Shift C"

* Go to http://www.postmachina.com/ and analyze and tweak this nicely designed page.

  * What is the current background color for the page?  (Surprisingly, it's not just black!)  "#0b0f11"
  * Tweak the background color to white.  "Did it"

  * Tweak the height of the side bar that contains the logo.  Shrink it down to 85px. "Did it!"

  * Roll over the navigation links.  When you hover over them, they dissapear.  Let's change the hover color to black instead.  "Did it!"

  * Now take a screenshot of your new (and maybe not so improved) design.  It should match this screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/5ak1jkpl5/
  "Did it!""


  * Upload your own image to the imgs directory in the `1_Chrome_Dev_Tools` directory.  It should match the image above. The last nav link in the image above is black because the mouse was hovering there when the screenshot was taken. Do the same, and don't take a screenshot of your whole desktop, just the browser window. (This is part of the challenge.)

* For the postmachina website, why can't you tweak the color of the text "The most important things are not things"?  Please explain.
"The text is a part of an gif image."

* Go to www.ticketswizard.com and analyze the page.  
  * What is the largest image on the website? "The Tickets Wizards Logo"
