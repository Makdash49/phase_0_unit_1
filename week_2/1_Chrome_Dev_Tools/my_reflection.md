# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
I'm not sure what it is.  I think it has something to do with grouping the code so that it's easier to read through.  Is the element inspector DOM?  I'm wondering what the connection is.  I'll look it up or ask someone about it sometime.


* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

My site is a lot less complicated than a wordpress site although the wordpress site is somewhat simpler than some sites I have looked at.  It has a lot more than I understand than other websites.


* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
At first, I had no idea what I was looking at and I was really confused and frustrated.  Fortunately, Justin and Kim showed me how to use it and then it became really helpful.


* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
My concepts were solidified when I realized that you could click on anything in a website and then see where the code is for it.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I did some google searches to tell me how to take screenshots.
