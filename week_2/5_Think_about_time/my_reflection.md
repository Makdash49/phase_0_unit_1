# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?


My biggest time management challenge during Phase 0 will be to complete the assignments on time while also learning as much as possible and putting that knowledge into the execution of the assignments.  There is a temptation to keep working on a project and improving it.  For the past two weeks I have been struggling to catch up since I started late.  Additionally, HTML and CSS are extremely new to me so that made progress slow going.  To stay on track, I've finished the projects in very basic ways.  I am hopeful that if I can start week three on schedule, I will be able to devote more time to quality.

I will stay on track by being mindful of how long it is taking to do a task, estimate how long it will take to get it done, and estimate how long other projects left to do will take. 

I think I would like to try the Pomodoro method although I'm not sure where I can find one of those tomato timers.  I'm sure I could order one online.  I wonder if a Pomodoro could double as a rubber ducky?  Does anyone sell Pomodoro rubber duckies?  If not, I've just come up with a brilliant business idea.

I also like the Counter-intuitive productivity method.  Recognizing that as a living human being and not a machine I have cycles of productivity.  I'll try to be in the flow of those cycles to do the most essential work when I am most capable of doing it well.  I also like taking the pressure off myself by trying to do almost nothing.  I think this may be helpful when I feel stuck or overwhelmed.  I'm going to take it one step at a time.

My overall plan for Phase 0 is to try to put in as much time and effort as I can.  Of course, I plan to pace myself and take breaks.  I also plan to have fun.
